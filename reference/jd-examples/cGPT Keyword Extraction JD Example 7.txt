Director, Product Management -Capital One Software (Remote)
Capital One has been a pioneer through our tech journey as the first large bank to go all in on the public cloud, while operating in a complex and highly regulated business environment.  We have built out a large engineering organization, moved to the cloud, re-architected our applications and data platforms, and embraced machine learning at scale. Our AI/ML capabilities are now at the forefront of what’s possible in banking. (e.g., Capital One Eno).
We are overcoming key data management challenges in the cloud related to data publishing, data consumption, data governance, and infrastructure management. To realize the full potential of our cloud and data strategy, we built new data management platforms in the cloud and solved new problems across the data ecosystem.
Our teams have also built and battle tested new capabilities to meet those needs. We’ve open sourced several of the software tools we built (e.g., Cloud Custodian, Hygieia) and forged new partnerships with other digital leaders (e.g., Microsoft, MSFT). 
Through this journey, we've developed a suite of internal solutions uniquely designed to meet the challenges of a digital-first, cloud-first business at scale.  We also recognize that many other businesses are facing similar data management needs as they accelerate their cloud and data journeys, and are exploring how best to bring some of the tools to market as enterprise B2B software solutions.
