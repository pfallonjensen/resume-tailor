KB 3A: Character Limit Adherence and Rephrasing Guidelines - Final Version
Purpose The purpose of KB 3A is to provide a clear set of rules for adhering to character limits and guidelines on how to rephrase bullet points to meet these limits without truncating the content. The focus is on adjusting length, preserving key outcomes, and maintaining the impact of the original bullet point, while strictly avoiding unsupported additions.

Sections:
3A.1 Character Limit Requirements
	•	One-Line Bullet Points: Each one-line bullet point should be between 80-116 characters.
	•	Two-Line Bullet Points: Each two-line bullet point should be between 175-235 characters.
	•	Middle-Length Bullet Points:
	•	Bullet points that fall between 117-174 characters should be adjusted to either fit the one-line or two-line requirement. Whenever possible, bias towards a shorter length to maintain conciseness while ensuring key information is preserved.
Cross-Reference for Verification:
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Gray Area Example List for examples where character limit adjustments required nuanced rephrasing while maintaining key outcomes.

3A.2 Guidance for Adjusting Length
	•	Always preserve core outcomes such as metrics or achievements when making adjustments.
	•	If shortening a bullet point, ensure that quantifiable achievements (e.g., percentages or revenue gains) are maintained.
	•	If expanding a bullet point to meet a two-line requirement, add context that is already implied in the resume, such as the methodology used or the value derived for the company.
	•	Note: Ensure that any added context is explicitly supported by evidence from the resume (KB 1 - Section 1.1: Direct Evidence Only), and explicitly reference the source of the context as per KB 1 - Section 1.2: Explicit Reference Mapping.
Cross-Reference for Verification:
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Positive Example List for cases where expanding bullet points successfully added supported value.

3A.3 No Truncation Clause
	•	No Truncation Requirement: Bullet points should never be truncated to meet character limits. Instead, rephrase to maintain both readability and impact.
	•	If a bullet point is too long, use the following tactics to rephrase:
	•	Remove Redundant Words: Delete any repetitive or unnecessary phrases that do not add value.
	•	Simplify Phrasing: Use more straightforward language.
	•	Reorder Sentences or Phrases: Find a way to communicate the same content with fewer words, without losing meaning.
	•	Note: When rephrasing, all changes must be based on content directly found in the resume. Refer to KB 1 - Section 1.1 (Direct Evidence Only) to avoid hallucinations, and refer to KB 1 - Section 1.2 (Explicit Reference Mapping) to ensure all changes are verifiable.
Cross-Reference for Verification:
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Negative Example List for scenarios where truncation led to a loss of critical information, compromising the bullet point's impact.

3A.4 Rephrasing Tactics with Expanded Examples
	•	Removing Redundant Words:
	•	Example:
	•	Before: "Successfully led a cross-functional team to achieve a 20% increase in efficiency."
	•	After: "Led a cross-functional team, achieving a 20% efficiency increase."
	•	Simplifying Phrasing:
	•	Example:
	•	Before: "Worked on optimizing the operational processes which ultimately resulted in a decrease in expenses."
	•	After: "Optimized operational processes, reducing expenses."
	•	Reordering Sentences for Better Flow:
	•	Example:
	•	Before: "Reduced customer churn by implementing a customer feedback system, which enabled better customer service."
	•	After: "Implemented a customer feedback system, reducing churn and improving service."
	•	Shorten Verb Phrases:
	•	Example:
	•	Before: "Was responsible for managing a team of five engineers."
	•	After: "Managed a team of five engineers."
	•	Combining Sentences for Cohesion:
	•	When bullet points contain multiple short sentences, consider combining them for a more cohesive and impactful statement.
	•	Example:
	•	Before: "Managed a product launch. Collaborated with marketing to increase engagement. Achieved 10% market share growth."
	•	After: "Managed a product launch in collaboration with marketing, achieving 10% market share growth."
Cross-Reference for Verification:
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Positive Example List for successful instances of combining sentences for greater impact.

3A.5 Use Active Voice to Improve Tone
	•	Always use active voice to make bullet points direct and assertive.
	•	Example:
	•	Before (Passive): "The new feature was implemented to enhance user engagement."
	•	After (Active): "Implemented a new feature to enhance user engagement."
Cross-Reference for Verification:
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Gray Area Example List for situations where passive-to-active voice conversion improved bullet clarity but needed verification for alignment.

3A.6 Character Length Compliance Review
	•	Review for Character Limit Adherence:
	•	After rephrasing, double-check the length to ensure that the bullet point meets the appropriate character range (either one-line or two-line).
	•	If any important metrics or outcomes are lost in rephrasing, attempt to reintroduce them concisely.
	•	Make sure that all core achievements, especially metrics, are preserved, as they add significant value to each bullet point.
	•	Note: Ensure no unsupported details are introduced during this step. Consult KB 1 - Section 1.1 (Direct Evidence Only), Section 1.2 (Explicit Reference Mapping), and Section 1.3 (No Assumptions from Job Descriptions Alone).
Cross-Reference for Verification:
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Negative Example List for cases where character adjustments led to unintended loss of critical metrics or unsupported additions.
	•	Refer to KB Examples - Positive Example List for examples of character length adherence done correctly, maintaining key metrics and outcomes.
