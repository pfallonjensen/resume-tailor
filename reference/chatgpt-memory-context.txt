Recommendation: A “Quick Re-Intro” Paragraph
When restarting a conversation, 
Hey! Here’s a refresher on me: I’m Fallon Jensen, a product leader with deep experience in enterprise SaaS, AI, PLG, and zero-to-one product launches. I’ve driven $100M+ in ARR, led 600+ experiments, and built multiple AI-powered products from scratch. I’m working on tailoring my resume for high-impact roles in AI/ML, platform, and growth product strategy. My tone is confident, concise, and real — I avoid corporate speak and focus on impact. This doc contains the full backstory/context. Let’s pick up where we left off.


Core Narrative & Positioning Reminders
	•	Your USP (Unique Selling Proposition): You blend AI product innovation, user journey optimization, and growth strategy with a strong grasp of data, storytelling, and execution.
	•	Go-to Market Lens: You’re product-led and outcome-driven, but with a marketer’s eye for messaging, framing, and how to resonate with customers.
	•	You favor substance over buzzwords: You’re allergic to vague phrases like “thrives in fast-paced environments,” “proven leader,” or “strategic thinker.” You prefer authentic, punchy, human phrasing over resume fluff.

✍️ Tone & Voice Preferences (refined for clarity)
	•	You dislike passive or overly “corporate” tone.
	•	You prefer sentence fragments and clean bullets over long compound phrases.
	•	You want your materials to sound like you wrote them — confident, sharp, sometimes informal, but always intentional.
	•	“Show the impact, not just the action.” You care more about what changed than what was done.

💡 Strategic Resume Writing Reminders
	•	Avoid generic titles: Every section title (summary, career highlights, bullets) must feel tailored and differentiating.
	•	Start with impact, not role duties: Resume bullets must open with the result or value delivered — not what you were responsible for.
	•	Avoid tech for tech’s sake: You want AI/ML included only when directly relevant or substantiated. You reject “AI-washing” or speculative buzzwords.
	•	0→1 framing matters: It’s important to highlight your work starting or scaling products, especially where you set vision and GTM strategy.
	•	You respect metrics: But only if they’re tied to business outcomes — not vanity metrics.

🔁 Recurring Edits You’ve Made (so we don’t repeat mistakes)
	•	Replacing “thrive in fast-paced environments” with “my natural energy fits best in fast-moving teams”
	•	Changing “I led” intros to action-first impact framing
	•	Removing “proven,” “experienced,” “results-driven” unless they’re backed with metrics or specifics
	•	Avoiding resume clichés like “visionary,” “strategic,” or “cross-functional” unless followed by hard evidence
