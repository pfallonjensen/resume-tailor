# Bullet Corpus Template
# =======================
# This file contains ALL variations of your resume bullets - every achievement,
# every way you've phrased something, every metric you have permission to claim.
#
# The anti-hallucination system uses this file as ground truth. If a word or phrase
# doesn't exist somewhere in this corpus, Claude won't propose edits using it.
#
# FORMAT GUIDE:
# -------------
# Organize by company/role, most recent first
# Include every variation you've ever written
# Include rejected drafts (they contain useful vocabulary)
# Don't worry about duplication - more is better for the validation system
